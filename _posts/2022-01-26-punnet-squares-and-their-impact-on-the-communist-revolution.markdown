Good morning blog that nobody reads, it's me, your boy.

I'm starting to work on a library for genetics work.  I know they already exist, but my gf was struggling with a dumb bio problem, so I decided to make one for myself.  It won't be the best, but it *will* be fully documented and typed as well as on NPM.

> very good strong typing yes

anyway, updates as i slowly go insane due to the fact that `{} !== [] && typeof {} === []`.
