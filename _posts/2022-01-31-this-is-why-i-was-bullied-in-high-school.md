Good afternoon blog that nobody reads, it's me, your boy.

Yesterday evening, the best sequence of messages to ever grace my game dev brain occurred.

> Chicken Soup for the Repressed Game Developer's Carpal Tunnel

After a couple hours of unrelated schoolwork, I started working on a prototype in [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com), my personal favorite engine, and managed to throw together a basic player class and a tileset using some sprites I got from OpenGameArt (Thank you [Emcee Flesher](https://opengameart.org/content/teeny-xeenies) for the CC-BY 4.0,) and by 3 am I had finished a mockup of front of my high school in the space tileset.

> The reasonably sized map I had made previously in [Ogmo3](https://ogmoeditor.itch.io/editor)

of course this size of map lasted for all of the 6 hours of sleep I got, and while taking care of dogs with my left hand I expanded the map with my right.

> no screenshot here because i forgot to take a middle one; please pretend there's an expanded screenshot here

...but that wouldn't hold me for long.  After implementing the tile collisions in potentially the worst way possible,

![CODE????](/assets/images/20220131/CODE.png)

> man i sure do love `[].concat([for (i in 0...1000000) i])`

I expanded it again.

and again.

*and again*

***and again***

for three full hours of manual tile placing pain.


### BUT IT'S WORTH IT!
##### because now the map is big.

I hope this actually turns out as well as it does in my head.

P.S. Willow is a trans rust programmer who gave me this idea to begin with, I'll link something of hers when she tells me what.

P.P.S. [https://docs.rs/trans/0.4.0/trans/](https://docs.rs/trans/0.4.0/trans/)

P.P.P.S. no more update logs for Mendel.js for now, it turned out that combining arrays in various formats is actually really boring.
